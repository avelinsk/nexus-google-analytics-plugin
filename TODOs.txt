-> stop the tracking threads, as for each GaTrackerRequestProcessor#process() a new TrackingThread is started. ?? May cause a memory leak (see Hc4ProviderImpl#finalize())

-> when I access nexus pro through a proxy, nexus uses org.sonatype.nexus.apachehttpclient.Hc4ProviderImpl#configureAuthentication()

-> test with scripts that run nightly downloading artifacts from repo-testing.coremedia.com per Nexus Rest API

-> test if plugin tracks a repository if it is in a group

-> send user statistics (username) along with the downloaded artifact's path (OS Java Version, however only from the Nexus Proxy host)
