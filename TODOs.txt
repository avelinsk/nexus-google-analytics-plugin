-> when I access nexus pro through a proxy, nexus uses org.sonatype.nexus.apachehttpclient.Hc4ProviderImpl#configureAuthentication()

-> test with scripts that run nightly downloading artifacts from repo-testing.coremedia.com per Nexus Rest API

-> test if plugin tracks a repository if it is in a group

-> send user statistics (username) along with the downloaded artifact's path (OS Java Version, however only from the Nexus Proxy host)

-> ADD UNIT TESTS WITH MOCKITO :-)

-> fix debug logging before deploying to repository.coremedia.com

-> fix the regex to exclude *.sha and *.sha1 and *.md5 (!)

-> check how to prepare reports to aggregate info for a single user with all downloaded artifacts
